        <h1>Ethereum LevelDB Explorer</h1>
        <p>
            The purpose of this tool is to be an educational resource for people
            trying to learn about Ethereum's data storage. This tool assumes
            deep understanding of how Ethereum's data looks like. If you ever
            wondered how Ethereum stores this blockchain data, this tool is for
            you.
        </p>
        <p>
            Generally speaking, Ethereum saves all of its data in a simple
            key/value store. But how would you save complex data structures such
            as blocks and transactions in a flat key/value store? Ethereum employes
            several different serialization techniques in order to achieve
            this.<br>
            For more information about these data structures, refer to the
            following resources:

            This tool works with the Sepolia testnet, but might not always be
            fully up-to-date. To confirm the results you get from this tool, you
            can cross-check them on <a href="https://sepolia.etherscan.io/" target=_blank>Etherscan</a>.<br>
            With this tool you can manually explore the LevelDB data by querying
            specific keys. It's as low-level as possible, since its main
            purpose is educational.<br>
            All the data, both keys and values, is saved in a binary format.
            This tool accepts and responds with hex-encoded binary data.
        </p>

            <h3>Cheatsheet for LevelDB keys</h3>
            Ethereum stores several top-level, mutable values:
            <ul>
                <li>LastBlock (in hex: <code>4c617374426c6f636b</code>)</li>
                <li>LastHeader (in hex: <code>4c617374486561646572</code>)</li>
                <li>LastFast (in hex: <code>4c61737446617374</code>)</li>
                <li>DatabaseVersion (in hex: <code>446174616261736556657273696f6e</code>)</li>
            </ul>

            Other keys are constructed using different prefixes &amp;
            suffixes. These are:
            <ul>
                <li><code>68</code> ("h")</li>
                <li><code>48</code> ("H")</li>
                <li><code>6e</code> ("n")</li>
                <li><code>62</code> ("b")</li>
                <li><code>74</code> ("t")</li>
                <li><code>72</code> ("r")</li>
                <li><code>42</code> ("B")</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Example</h4>
            To find a block hash by its number, you would concatenate the "h"
            prefix (<code>68</code>) and the "n" suffix (<code>6e</code>). Once
            you find the block hash, you can retrieve its block data.<br>
            To find the block header data, you would concatenate the "b" prefix
            (<code>62</code>) with the block number (in hex and padded to 16
            digits) and the block hash.<br><br>

            Let's take block number 2,505,997 as an example
            <ul>
                <li>
                    In hex, the number is <code>263d0d</code>. Padded to 16
                    digits: <code>0000000000263d0d</code>
                </li>
                <li>
                    To find the block hash, we query for
                    <code><b>68</b>0000000000263d0d<b>6e</b></code>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Then we take the result (<code>9d32afbe77c7d105253b4ed7750caf23063352936ce357b89a9dd54c9fa24ab1</code>) and use the "H"
                    prefix along with the block number and the hash to find the
                    block data:
                    <code><b>62</b>0000000000263d0d9d32afbe77c7d105253b4ed7750caf23063352936ce357b89a9dd54c9fa24ab1</code>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Decoding the results that come from the LevelDB is beyond the scope
            of this text, but this tool provides several decoders that let you
            decode the results in different ways. Different values require
            different decoders &mdash; make sure you use the right decoder.
