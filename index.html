            <p>
                The purpose of this tool is to be an educational resource for people
                trying to learn about Ethereum's data storage. This tool assumes
                deep understanding of how Ethereum's data looks like. If you ever
                wondered how Ethereum stores its blockchain data, this tool is for
                you.
            </p>
            <p>
                This tool is based on the Geth implementation using LevelDB.<br>
                Since the Yellow Paper never provided an actual implementation,
                different clients implement the Ethereum database differently,
                but because of the use of very specific mathematical concepts,
                most clients implement the database very similarly.
            </p>
            <p>
                Generally speaking, Ethereum saves all of its data in a simple
                key/value store. But how would you save complex data structures such
                as blocks and transactions in a flat key/value store? Ethereum employes
                several different serialization techniques in order to achieve
                this.<br>
                For more information about these data structures, refer to the
                following resources:

                This tool works with the Sepolia testnet and is currently updated
                until block <code id="lastBlock"></code>. To confirm the results you get from this tool, you
                can cross-check them on <a href="https://sepolia.etherscan.io/" target=_blank>Etherscan</a>.<br>
                With this tool you can manually explore the LevelDB data by querying
                specific keys. It's as low-level as possible, since its main
                purpose is educational.<br>
                All the data, both keys and values, is saved in a binary format.
                This tool accepts and responds with hex-encoded binary data.
            </p>
            <p>
                The decoding scheme of the results that come from the LevelDB is
                beyond the scope of this text, but this tool provides several
                decoders that let you decode the results in different ways.
                Different values require different decoders &mdash; make sure
                you use the appropriate decoder for each piece of data.

            <summary>LevelDB keys</summary>
            <p>
                Ethereum stores several top-level keys with mutable values:
                <ul>
                    <li>LastBlock (in hex: <code>4c617374426c6f636b</code>)</li>
                    <li>LastHeader (in hex: <code>4c617374486561646572</code>)</li>
                    <li>LastFast (in hex: <code>4c61737446617374</code>)</li>
                    <li>DatabaseVersion (in hex: <code>446174616261736556657273696f6e</code>)</li>
                </ul>

                Keys relating to parsing blocks are constructed using different
                prefixes &amp; suffixes. These are:
                <ul>
                    <li><code>68</code> ("h")</li>
                    <li><code>48</code> ("H")</li>
                    <li><code>6e</code> ("n")</li>
                    <li><code>62</code> ("b")</li>
                    <li><code>74</code> ("t")</li>
                    <li><code>72</code> ("r")</li>
                    <li><code>42</code> ("B")</li>
                </ul>

                The rest of the keys that are stored in the DB are hashes that
                comprise different Merkle tries. More on that below.

            <summary>Retrieving Block Data</summary>
            <p>
                Retrieving block data requires using the block number and/or
                hash in order to construct the keys that hold the data that we
                want.
            </p>
            <h4>Example - Retrieving block headers</h4>
            <p>
                To find a block hash by its number, you would concatenate the "h"
                prefix (<code>68</code>) and the "n" suffix (<code>6e</code>). Once
                you find the block hash, you can retrieve its header data.<br>
                To find the header data, you would concatenate the "h" prefix
                (<code>68</code>) with the block number (in hex and padded to 16
                digits) and the block hash.<br><br>

                Let's take block number 2,505,997 as an example
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        In hex, the number is <code>263d0d</code>. Padded to 16
                        digits: <code>0000000000263d0d</code>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        To find the block hash, we query for
                        <code><b>68</b>0000000000263d0d<b>6e</b></code>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Then we take the result
                        (<code>9d32afbe77c7d105253b4ed7750caf23063352936ce357b89a9dd54c9fa24ab1</code>)
                        and use the "h" prefix along with the block number and
                        the hash to find the block header:
                        <code><b>68</b>0000000000263d0d9d32afbe77c7d105253b4ed7750caf23063352936ce357b89a9dd54c9fa24ab1</code>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                We can use the "Block Header" decoder to parse the result into
                the different fields of the header. Of these fields, notable
                are:
                <ul>
                    <li><code>stateRoot</code></li>
                    <li><code>transactionsRoot</code></li>
                    <li><code>recieptsRoot</code></li>
                </ul>
                These values represent <b>root hashes</b> that let you traverse
                their respective tries. More on that below.

            <summary>Traversing Modified Merkle-Patricia Tries in LevelDB</summary>
            <p>
                Ethereum uses two kinds of tries to save data in a cryptographically
                secure yet efficient way:
                <ul>
                    <li>Modified Patricia Trie</li>
                    <li>Merkle Trie</li>
                </ul>
                Explaining these trie structures or why Ethereum utilizes them
                is beyond the scope of this tool.
            </p>
            <p>
                These two tries can be constructed from the key/value pairs in the
                DB. The <b>keys</b> in the DB are part of the Merkle trie, while the
                <b>values</b> are part of the Patricia trie.<br>
                Generally speaking, if you are trying to retrieve raw data, you need
                to construct the Patricia trie from the values, but if you are
                trying to validate the data, you need to construct the Merkle trie
                from the keys.
            </p>
            <h4>Example - Retrieving account data</h4>
            <p>
                Let's take block 2,500,039 (<code>2625c7</code> in hex). We can
                get the hash and header data as explained above. From the header
                we can extract the <code>stateRoot</code>, which is:<br>
                <code>644ae129f630e6c5c864b2dbd634c50fe479d631ef76ae1e9ceb5220bca949c5</code>
            </p>
            <p>
                The <code>stateRoot</code> is the <b>key</b> for our root nodes.
                The value stored on this key in the DB is the root Patricia
                node, while the key itself is the root Merkle node.<br>
                Querying this key will give us an RLP-encoded value that
                represents 1 of 4 kinds of Patricia nodes:
                <ul>
                    <li>Empty Node (0 items)</li>
                    <li>Branch Node (17 items)</li>
                    <li>Leaf Node (2 items; value starts with <code>2</code> or <code>3</code>)</li>
                    <li>Extension Node (2 items; value starts with <code>0</code> or <code>1</code>)</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                Querying for our block's <code>stateRoot</code> gives us a
                17-item long <b>branch node</b>. Each item in the branch node
                represents a hex character from <code>0</code> to
                <code>f</code>.<br>
                In order to find the balance of an account in the State Trie, we
                need to traverse the Patricia trie following the keccak256 hash
                of the address we want to query. Let's take the following
                address as an example:<br>
                <code>0x3810d4c7eB88dd66ab9bE39A5F567Cf77fF9f8B7</code><br>
                Its keccak256 value (without the <code>0x</code> part) is:<br>
                <code>acf0daf35759515a3118de4ab5ff63ec27518b94b03d601ac7a1e53b3d6603f8</code><br>
                We need to traverse the Patricia trie for every character in the
                hash. We start from <code>a</code> which is the first character
                in our keccak hash.<br>
                We take the item at index 10 (which is <code>a</code> in hex)
                of the root Patricia node, which is:<br>
                <code>c4ee4cf0cab88b6932d7380a6e0efdc33c1d4f0ffa05207f7a1450b45a97972a</code><br>
                We then query that key to get the next Patricia node. The next
                patricia node is also a branch node, and so we follow it, taking
                the key from the <code>c</code> place in the Patricia branch
                node, which is:<br>
                <code>51f41878a482a7e1a60e91b8e5c66333d119339dc067363b681ad7f7e6581c39</code><br>
                We keep traversing this way, <code>f</code>, <code>0</code>,
                <code>d</code>.<br>
                At this point, we get the next node's <b>key</b>:<br>
                <code>8b97f78fa20cfba908a4953654b4fcdc55c94a3df3305548e1e16eb549c19672</code><br>
                When we query this key, we get a <b>Leaf node</b>. We can
                identify it because if we decode it with RLP, we get 2 items and
                the value of the first item starts with <code>3</code>. This
                type of node is built of two items: the rest of our "path" and
                the final <b>value</b> of our account.<br>
                If we take the first item of this node and remove the
                <code>3</code>, we get:<br>
                <code>af35759515a3118de4ab5ff63ec27518b94b03d601ac7a1e53b3d6603f8</code><br>
                If this string seems familiar, it's because it's part of the
                hash that we were searching for:<br>
                <code>acf0d<b>af35759515a3118de4ab5ff63ec27518b94b03d601ac7a1e53b3d6603f8</b></code><br>
                We traversed through <code>a</code>, <code>c</code>,
                <code>f</code>, <code>0</code>, <code>d</code>, to get to this
                node, which contains the rest of our hash and our desired value
                - 4 items, encoded with RLP, that represent (in order) the
                account data:
                <ol>
                    <li>Nonce</li>
                    <li>Balance</li>
                    <li>storageRoot</li>
                    <li>codeHash</li>
                </ol>
                Looking at the balance, we get <code>b1a2bc2ec50000</code>,
                which converted to decimal becomes
                <code>50000000000000000</code>. This balance is in wei, so it's
                0.05 eth. We can confirm on <a href="https://sepolia.etherscan.io/balancecheck-tool?a=0x3810d4c7eb88dd66ab9be39a5f567cf77ff9f8b7" target=_blank>Etherscan</a> that at block height
                2,500,039, address <code>0x3810d4c7eB88dd66ab9bE39A5F567Cf77fF9f8B7</code>
                had 0.05 eth in its balance.
            </p>
            <p>
                The same technique of traversing the state trie can be used for
                traversing the transactions trie or the receipts trie.

            <summary>Contract Storage</summary>
            <p>
                In order to understand how contract state is stored in the DB, we
                need to look at how the EVM handles contract state. This text
                assumes good understanding of how the EVM works and what
                opcodes are. Explaining these concepts is out-of-scope.<br>
                One more important thing to note: different languages (Solidity,
                Vyper, etc) compile into different bytecode. The process
                described here is based on how Solidity implements its compiler,
                but most other EVM languages mimic the same behavior.
                Some information about Solidity's scheme is presented in their
                documentation:<br>
                <a href="https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.17/internals/layout_in_storage.html" target=_blank>https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.17/internals/layout_in_storage.html</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                To store contract state in the EVM, we use an opcode called
                <code>SSTORE</code>. The <code>SSTORE</code> opcode has two
                operands: a <code>slot</code> and a 256-bit array to be stored.
                The <code>slot</code> is a <code>uint256</code>. When a contract
                is trying to store some data, it invokes the <code>SSTORE</code>
                opcode with the slot number it wants to write into.<br>
                When you compile a Solidity contract, Solidity transforms it
                into bytecode. When you write to variable, Solidity translates
                its position in the code into a slot number. So the first
                variable goes into slot <code>0</code>, the second goes into
                slot <code>1</code>, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
                Let's look at a simplified example:
                <pre>
contract Example {
    uint256 a = 123;
}
                </pre>
                This contract will compile into something roughly equivalent of
                <code>sstore(0, 123)</code>.<br>
                Important to note that the variable name is meaningless when
                referencing data inside Ethereum's LevelDB storage. The only
                thing that matters is its position, from which we can derive its
                slot.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now let's get back to LevelDB. So how can we access this data
                from LevelDB?<br>
                When the EVM processes <code>SSTORE</code>, it's actually
                writing into LevelDB in the background. For every
                <code>SSTORE</code> operation, the EVM translates the slot into
                a LevelDB key where it will store the value.<br>
                Solidity supports 5 types of data structures:
                <ul>
                    <li>Fixed-size values (numbers, addresses)</li>
                    <li>Fixed-size Arrays (including 31-byte strings)</li>
                    <li>Dynamic Arrays (including long strings)</li>
                    <li>Mappings</li>
                    <li>Structs</li>
                </ul>
                Each of these data structures is saved using a slightly
                different scheme. We will go over how some of these are saved
                using examples.
            </p>
            <p>
                To retrieve a storage slot from LevelDB, we need to use both our
                account / contract address and the slot we want to retrieve.
            </p>
            <h4>Example 1: Read the "name" of an ERC20</h4>
            <p>
                Let's look at contract
                <code>0x5fb282df60a3264c06b2cb36c74d0fd23d727f82</code>. It's an
                ERC20 contract that follows the OpenZeppelin implementation.
                Looking <a href="https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol#L35" target=_blank>at the code</a> we can see the
                <code>name</code> variable is fourth, meaning it will be stored
                in slot <code>3</code> (0-based index).<br>
                We now retrieve the account details for this contract in the
                manner described previously. We will use block 2,505,997 as our
                head. Its block header can be found here:<br>
                <code>680000000000263d0d9d32afbe77c7d105253b4ed7750caf23063352936ce357b89a9dd54c9fa24ab1</code><br>
                We take the state root and find the account details as we did
                previously. The keccak256 of the address is:<br>
                <code>c6c986aabcc27ea73df5b336048692ab9cab96645861b869da7b6935a1aa29ab</code><br>
                We traverse the <code>stateRoot</code> trie same as before,
                until we reach the leaf node for this account:<br>
                <code>f12c6be1635c47f9a9aaeef51429e19bf43bcde0fe1ee1894b331dd68e7cab74</code><br>
                From that we extract the <code>storageRoot</code> for the
                account. This is a Merkle-Patricia root, and we can traverse it
                like any other Merkle-Patricia Trie:<br>
                <code>df20e5cf9e6aef54d16c6123d87957fe1c7c591a82cb03073432ec7375c65648</code><br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Now we can find our storage slots. To find slots, we take their
                index and find that index on the Patricia trie, starting from
                the <code>storageRoot</code>.<br>
                We know the "name" variable is stored in slot <code>3</code>.
                Slot numbers are always padded to 32 bytes and then hased, so
                we take the padded number:<br>
                <code>0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000003</code><br>
                Hash it with keccak256:<br>
                <code>c2575a0e9e593c00f959f8c92f12db2869c3395a3b0502d05e2516446f71f85b</code><br>
                And traverse the <code>storageRoot</code> trie to find that key.
                After traversing <code>c</code>, <code>2</code>, <code>5</code>,
                we get to the leaf node that containes our value:<br>
                <code>0b49a92e9302e8d45d0ce6acd86eee8ea4a83fc447bc7f9e629febb197ece43d</code><br>
            </p>
            <p>
                We can now see the value stored in slot <code>3</code>, but it's
                encoded:<br>
                <code>a04255534420546f6b656e00000000000000000000000000000000000000000014</code><br>
                Solidity encodes strings that are 31-bytes or smaller directly in
                a single slot. The first byte (in this example, <code>a0</code>)
                we ignore. The <b>last</b> byte (in this example,
                <code>14</code>) encodes the length of string. <code>14</code>
                is hex, converted to decimal it's <code>20</code>. So our string
                are the 20 digits following the <code>a0</code> byte, and then
                those bits are our ASCII/UTF encoded string:
                <code>4255534420546f6b656e</code><br>
                We can use Javascript to decode it (any other language can also
                work):<br>
                <pre>
'4255534420546f6b656e'.match(/.{1,2}/g).map(v =&gt; String.fromCharCode(parseInt(v, 16))).join('')
                </pre>
                Or in Node.js:
                <pre>
Buffer.from('4255534420546f6b656e', 'hex').toString('utf8')
                </pre>
                And we get: <code>BUSD Token</code><br>
            </p>
