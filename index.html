                The purpose of this tool is to be an educational resource for people
                trying to learn about Ethereum's data storage. This tool assumes
                deep understanding of how Ethereum's data looks like. If you ever
                wondered how Ethereum stores this blockchain data, this tool is for
                you.
            </p>
            <p>
                Generally speaking, Ethereum saves all of its data in a simple
                key/value store. But how would you save complex data structures such
                as blocks and transactions in a flat key/value store? Ethereum employes
                several different serialization techniques in order to achieve
                this.<br>
                For more information about these data structures, refer to the
                following resources:

                This tool works with the Sepolia testnet, but might not always be
                fully up-to-date. To confirm the results you get from this tool, you
                can cross-check them on <a href="https://sepolia.etherscan.io/" target=_blank>Etherscan</a>.<br>
                With this tool you can manually explore the LevelDB data by querying
                specific keys. It's as low-level as possible, since its main
                purpose is educational.<br>
                All the data, both keys and values, is saved in a binary format.
                This tool accepts and responds with hex-encoded binary data.

            <summary>Retrieving Block Data</summary>
            <p>
                Ethereum stores several top-level, mutable values:
                <ul>
                    <li>LastBlock (in hex: <code>4c617374426c6f636b</code>)</li>
                    <li>LastHeader (in hex: <code>4c617374486561646572</code>)</li>
                    <li>LastFast (in hex: <code>4c61737446617374</code>)</li>
                    <li>DatabaseVersion (in hex: <code>446174616261736556657273696f6e</code>)</li>
                </ul>

                Other keys are constructed using different prefixes &amp;
                suffixes. These are:
                <ul>
                    <li><code>68</code> ("h")</li>
                    <li><code>48</code> ("H")</li>
                    <li><code>6e</code> ("n")</li>
                    <li><code>62</code> ("b")</li>
                    <li><code>74</code> ("t")</li>
                    <li><code>72</code> ("r")</li>
                    <li><code>42</code> ("B")</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Example</h4>
                To find a block hash by its number, you would concatenate the "h"
                prefix (<code>68</code>) and the "n" suffix (<code>6e</code>). Once
                you find the block hash, you can retrieve its header data.<br>
                To find the header data, you would concatenate the "h" prefix
                (<code>68</code>) with the block number (in hex and padded to 16
                digits) and the block hash.<br><br>

                Let's take block number 2,505,997 as an example
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        In hex, the number is <code>263d0d</code>. Padded to 16
                        digits: <code>0000000000263d0d</code>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        To find the block hash, we query for
                        <code><b>68</b>0000000000263d0d<b>6e</b></code>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Then we take the result (<code>9d32afbe77c7d105253b4ed7750caf23063352936ce357b89a9dd54c9fa24ab1</code>) and use the "H"
                        prefix along with the block number and the hash to find the
                        block data:
                        <code><b>68</b>0000000000263d0d9d32afbe77c7d105253b4ed7750caf23063352936ce357b89a9dd54c9fa24ab1</code>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                Decoding the results that come from the LevelDB is beyond the scope
                of this text, but this tool provides several decoders that let you
                decode the results in different ways. Different values require
                different decoders &mdash; make sure you use the right decoder.

            <summary>Traversing the Tries</summary>
            <p>
                Ethereum uses two kinds of tries to save data in a cryptographically
                secure yet efficient way:
                <ul>
                    <li>Modified Patricia Trie</li>
                    <li>Merkle Trie</li>
                </ul>
                Explaining these trie structures is beyond the scope of this
                tool.
            </p>
            <p>
                These two tries can be constructed from the key/value pairs in the
                DB. The <b>keys</b> in the DB are part of the Merkle trie, while the
                <b>values</b> are part of the Patricia trie.<br>
                Generally speaking, if you are trying to retrieve raw data, you need
                to construct the Patricia trie from the values, but if you are
                trying to validate the data, you need to construct the Merkle trie
                from the keys.
            </p>
            <h4>Example</h4>
            <p>
                Let's take block 2,500,039 (<code>2625c7</code> in hex). We can
                get the hash and header data as explained above. From the header
                we can extract the <code>stateRoot</code>, which is:<br>
                <code>644ae129f630e6c5c864b2dbd634c50fe479d631ef76ae1e9ceb5220bca949c5</code>
            </p>
            <p>
                The <code>stateRoot</code> is the <b>key</b> for our root nodes.
                The value of this key in the DB is the root Patricia node, while
                the key itself is the root Merkle node.<br>
                Querying this key will give us an RLP-encoded value that
                represents 1 of 4 kinds of Patricia nodes:
                <ul>
                    <li>Empty Node (0 items)</li>
                    <li>Branch Node (17 items)</li>
                    <li>Leaf Node (2 items)</li>
                    <li>Extension Node (2 items)</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                Querying for our block's <code>stateRoot</code> gives us a
                17-item long <b>branch node</b>. Each item in the branch node
                represents a hex character from <code>0</code> to
                <code>f</code>.<br>
                In order to find the balance of an account in the State Trie, we
                need to traverse the Patricia trie following the keccak256 hash
                of the address we want to query. Let's take the following
                address as an example:<br>
                <code>0x3810d4c7eB88dd66ab9bE39A5F567Cf77fF9f8B7</code><br>
                Its keccak256 value (without the <code>0x</code> part) is:<br>
                <code>9c8fac36329c5c0b6089b78700f8b1e20ab13182e1abf37c894d174003c5d5db</code><br>
                We need to traverse the Patricia trie for every character in the
                hash. We start from <code>9</code> which is the first character
                in our hash.<br>
                We take the item in index 9 (10th item) of the root Patricia
                node, which is:<br>
                <code>87d63dddcfce8ebdb184b440846dc9833ce26aa29e035b669b6835b0146a6eee</code><br>
                We then query that key to get the next Patricia node. The next
                patricia node is also a branch node, and so we follow it, taking
                the key from the <code>c</code> place in the Patricia branch
                node, which is:<br>
                <code>1b38ff675fa5438b7f183c5fa0625e33451db78c7cbac753a72d100e277519a3</code><br>
                We keep traversing this way, <code>9</code>, <code>c</code>,
                <code>8</code>, <code>f</code>, <code>a</code>, etc.
