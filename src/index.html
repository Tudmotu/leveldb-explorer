            The purpose of this tool is to be an educational resource for people
            trying to learn about Ethereum's data storage. If you ever wondered
            how Ethereum stores the blockchain, this tool is for you.<br>
            Generally speaking, Ethereum saves all of its data in a simple
            key/value store. But how would you save complex data structures such
            as blocks and transactions in a key/value store? Ethereum employes
            several different serialization tatics in order to achieve this. For
            more information about these data structures, refer to the following
            resources:
